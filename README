PolishMath

In these files, I use Polish Math Notation to simplify algebraic equations. By creating an object called MathProblem and giving the algebraic equation as a string, one just has to call solve() to simplify it. 

Features to Fix:
^ (exponent) does not thoroughly account for all possibility
add trigonometric functions, pi, e, and log compatibility
